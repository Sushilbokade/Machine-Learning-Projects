# Machine Learning Projects.

   - ## Breast Cancer Classification:
      - The primary focus of this machine learning model is to be able to diffrentiate between malignant and benign tumors based on the tumor shape and its geometry.
      - The data was extracted from scikit learn library.
      - In here Seaborn library is been used for visualizations.
      - In here Support Vector Machine algorithm is used to train the model.
      - In the end to improve the model GridSearchCv is been used to select the best parameters from the listed hyperparameters.
   
  - ## Flights Fare Prediction Using Machine Learning:
      - The primary focus of this project is to use Machine Learning to Predict the Fare of Airlines tickets.
      - Here Data Preprocessing, Data Wrangling, Feature selection is being practiced.
      - Here Multiple Machine Learning algorithms have been used.
      - Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and KNN Regressor have been used.
      - Also Hyperparameter Tuning is done here to get best parameters and have best score.
  
   - ## Password Strength Classifier:
      - The primary focus of this project is to provide knowledge to the user about how Strong is the password which the user is likely to use for their security.
      - Here the concept of Natural Language Processing and Machine is being used.
      - Here TF - IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency), an NLP technique is being used to Preprocess the text data into vectors for ML models.
      - XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is being used for more accurate performance.
