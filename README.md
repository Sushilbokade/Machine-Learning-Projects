# Machine Learning Projects.
   
  - ## Flights Fare Prediction Using Machine Learning:
    - The primary focus of this project is to use Machine Learning to Predict the Fare of Airlines tickets.
    - Here Data Preprocessing, Data Wrangling, Feature selection is being practiced.
    - Here Multiple Machine Learning algorithms have been used.
    - Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and KNN Regressor have been used.
    - Also Hyperparameter Tuning is done here to get best parameters and have best score.
  
   - ## Password Strength Classifier:
    - The primary focus of this project is to provide knowledge to the user about how Strong is the password which the user is likely to use for their security.
    - Here the concept of Natural Language Processing and Machine is being used.
    - Here TF - IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency), an NLP technique is being used to Preprocess the text data into vectors for ML models.
    - XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is being used for more accurate performance.
