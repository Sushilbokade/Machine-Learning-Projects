## Anticipating Menstrual Migraines with Deep Learning

* **Goal:** Empower women with a tool to predict menstrual migraines, aiding early intervention and personalized treatment (traditional migraine medication may not be suitable).
* **Method:** Deep learning models trained on anonymized data to classify migraines as menstrual or non-menstrual.
* **Progress:** Exploratory data analysis (EDA) identified 24 relevant features. Experimentation with various deep learning architectures is ongoing.
* **Impact:** Improved quality of life for women suffering from menstrual migraines.
* **Next Steps:** Model refinement, potential app/web integration for user convenience.
