**Title:** Gaze Detection Project (WIP)

**Description:**

This project is an ongoing exploration of gaze detection technology. It aims to identify where a user's gaze falls on the screen, providing valuable insights into user behavior. This information can be leveraged for various applications, including:

* **User Interface (UI) Design:** Optimize website and application layouts to enhance user experience by placing crucial elements within the user's natural viewing area.
* **Marketing and Advertising:** Analyze user attention towards specific elements on a webpage or advertisement, enabling A/B testing of different creative elements for better engagement and conversion rates.
* **Accessibility:** Tailor user interfaces to accommodate individuals with visual impairments by understanding how they interact with the screen.

**Current Stage:**

This project is currently under development. The included files and Jupyter notebooks represent ongoing work on implementing gaze detection algorithms and evaluating their accuracy.

**Technical Stack:**

* Programming Language(s) (Specify the languages used, e.g., Python, JavaScript)
* Machine Learning Libraries (Mention specific libraries used, e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow.js)
* Data Acquisition Techniques (How are you capturing gaze data? Eye trackers?)

**Future Work:**

* Further refinement of gaze detection models for improved accuracy.
* Integration with web applications or other platforms for real-world application.
* Exploration of data visualization techniques to effectively communicate user gaze patterns.

**Contribution Guidelines:**

If you're interested in contributing to this project, feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

* Clearly explain any code modifications or additions.
* Provide relevant test cases to ensure code quality and functionality.
* Adhere to code style conventions for consistency.
