# Breast Cancer Classification:
-  The primary focus of this machine learning model is to be able to differentiate between malignant and benign tumours based on the tumour shape and its geometry.
-  The data was extracted from Scikit learn library. Here Seaborn library is been used for visualizations.
-  In here Support Vector Machine algorithm is used to train the model.
-  In the end, to improve the model GridSearchCV from Scikit learn library is been used to select the best parameters from the listed hyperparameters.
