# Flights Fare Prediction Using Machine Learning:
-  The primary focus of this project is to use Machine Learning to Predict the Fare of Airlines tickets.
-  Here Data Preprocessing, Data Wrangling, Feature selection is being practiced.
-  Here Multiple Machine Learning algorithms have been used.
-  Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and KNN Regressor have been used.
-  Also Hyperparameter Tuning is done here to get best parameters and have best score.
